## Synopsis

Simple app that shows the **Service** and the **Persistence** layers of a typical Hibernate app. The app is
a eGradebook which should display the grades of the students in different classes.

**Table Relationships**
We have created a variety of table relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.

This project only displays the backend so there is no MVC here. The functionality is tested using JUnit.
